# ERC721 Vault

## Introduction

This repo serves as supporting material for this EIP which proposes an ERC721 Vault contract which itself is also an ERC721. As the popularity of NFTs are growing, the amount of NFTs owned and transferred by users are following suit. This standard would allow users as well as organisations to package multiple NFTs into a consolidated vault NFT which only the owner of the vault can interact with.
